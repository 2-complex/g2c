Filenames all lower case.

When a class is defined in a single file of its own, that file should be named after the class, but
in general, classes may share a file.  In fact, classes which depend on each other should be
grouped into a single file.  If class B depends on class A, A may be separated into a file of its
own when there is a use-case for that class being used without B.

Lines of code shall not exceed 100 charactes in length.

Braces for control structures and function definitions go on the following line so that they
line up horizontally.

if( ... )
{
	
}
else
{
	
}

NOT

if( ... ) {
	
}

Control structures without braces are allowed with an indent.

if( ... )
	foo();

NOT

if( ... ) foo();


No tab characters allowed in c++ files.

End of line characters are '\n', that's ascii character 10, not ascii character 13.

Other than here in this rule forbidding it, the word "simple" is stricken from this project.  In
general, language which implies that code is easy to understand shall be avoided.  Understanding
software is something that comes with years of practice, and the work required to understand the
code in this project will not be trivialized in the language of the documentation.  Comments or
other documentation shall be used to describe what functions classes and other parts of the code do
without carrying implication of ease or difficulty of use.
